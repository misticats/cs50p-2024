## Key Concepts
- pytest

## Back to the Bank - bank.py, test_bank.py
In a file called bank.py, reimplement Home Federal Savings Bank from Problem Set 1, restructuring your code per the below, wherein value expects a str as input and returns an int, namely 0 if that str starts with “hello”, 20 if that str starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), or 100 otherwise, treating the str case-insensitively. You can assume that the string passed to the value function will not contain any leading spaces. Only main should call print.

```
def main():
    ...

def value(greeting):
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then, in a file called test_bank.py, implement three or more functions that collectively test your implementation of value thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

```
pytest test_bank.py
```

## Refueling - fuel.py, test_fuel.py
In a file called fuel.py, reimplement Fuel Gauge from Problem Set 3, restructuring your code per the below, wherein:

- convert expects a str in X/Y format as input, wherein each of X and Y is a positive integer, and returns that fraction as a percentage rounded to the nearest int between 0 and 100, inclusive. If X and/or Y is not an integer, or if X is greater than Y, then convert should raise a ValueError. If Y is 0, then convert should raise a ZeroDivisionError.
- gauge expects an int and returns a str that is:
  - "E" if that int is less than or equal to 1,
  - "F" if that int is greater than or equal to 99,
  - and "Z%" otherwise, wherein Z is that same int.

```
def main():
    ...

def convert(fraction):
    ...

def gauge(percentage):
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then, in a file called test_fuel.py, implement two or more functions that collectively test your implementations of convert and gauge thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

```
pytest test_fuel.py
```


## Re-requesting a Vanity Plate - plates.py, test_plates.py
In a file called plates.py, reimplement Vanity Plates from Problem Set 2, restructuring your code per the below, wherein is_valid still expects a str as input and returns True if that str meets all requirements and False if it does not, but main is only called if the value of __name__ is "__main__":

```
def main():
    ...

def is_valid(s):
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then, in a file called test_plates.py, implement four or more functions that collectively test your implementation of is_valid thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

```
pytest test_plates.py
```

## Testing my twttr - twttr.py, test_twttr.py
In a file called twttr.py, reimplement Setting up my twttr from Problem Set 2, restructuring your code per the below, wherein shorten expects a str as input and returns that same str but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

```
def main():
    ...

def shorten(word):
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then, in a file called test_twttr.py, implement one or more functions that collectively test your implementation of shorten thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

```
pytest test_twttr.py
```
