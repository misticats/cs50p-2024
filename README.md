# CS50P (2024)
This repository contains my code for the problem sets and final project from **CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python (2024)**, a course by Harvard University.

The goal of this repository is mainly to document my learning progress and to practice fundamental Python concepts through structured weekly assignments and a final project.


## About CS50P
CS50P is an introductory Python course that focuses on problem-solving and practical programming skills. Topics covered throughout the course include:

- Variables and functions
- Conditionals and loops
- Exceptions and input validation
- Libraries and modules
- File I/O
- Unit testing
- Regular expressions
- Object-oriented programming
- Designing and implementing a small project


## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by problem sets, following the course structure:

```
.
├── Problem Set 0 - Functions, Variables
├── Problem Set 1 - Conditionals
├── Problem Set 2 - Loops
├── Problem Set 3 - Exceptions
├── Problem Set 4 - Libraries
├── Problem Set 5 - Testing
├── Problem Set 6 - File I/O
├── Problem Set 7 - Regular Expressions
├── Problem Set 8 - OOP
├── Final Project
└── README.md
```

Each folder contains one or more Python scripts with my implementations of the corresponding exercises.


## Running the Code
Most files can be run directly with Python 3:

```
python filename.py
```

Some programs expect user input via the terminal, and a few may require command-line arguments, depending on the assignment.


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Some problem sets may use additional libraries such as pytest for testing.

If needed, you can install dependencies with:
```
pip install pytest
```
